To Do List
- convert px to em
- add alt=" " to all images
- maybe have a separate linkable page for each topic ex/ mooufo.com/gaming
- personal section, can be bf, family, dog, self improvement goals, fitness, progress log, currently working on, fav tv shows etc
- bread crumb subcategories: Beauty > Makeup > Lipsticks
   - ny times uses section > column > article
- maybe use reddit as comment section
- alphabeticize menu
- pagination
- breadcrumb
- shop, portfolio, blog (maybe separate websites if i want job)
- watermark, disable download
- provide permalink for sharing (write something about linking to the blog/credditing blog)
- some of these aren't really article worthy, just a few sentences that don't need a whole separate page or multiple pictures can link to one page.



-create a separate page that lists all articles under one tag with no images maybe. and make that sortable by tag.
- I could make row sections: so each row is one topic and then press read more to open just that topic section on a new page.
- write description of what the social media is used for and what each section/tag is about.



EXAMPLE OF COLLAPSABLE MENU
 <button class="collapsible tag tag-c2" onclick="filterSelection('cross')">Cross-Stitch</button>
    <div class = "expand"> <!-- div required to not show background of contents-->
    <button class="tag tag-c2" onclick="filterSelection('pattern')">Pattern</button>
    <button class="tag tag-c2" onclick="filterSelection('crossproduct')">Product review</button>
 </div>

-maybe have no subcategories
Memo: look at list of subreddits, categories of newspapers, google "blog topics" or "what topic to blog about"

1. I put sidenav in a separate html so that I don't have to edit the sidenav on every single page. This doesn't have to be in a sep html if i figure out how to do pagination (since the blog posts would be in a sep html). Also collapsible.js doesn't work when sidenav is in separate html but idk why filter works.

- research what the meta tags should look like for non "index.html" pages
- have different tag style for section > column > article (maybe have a color/style  index)
-replace font awesome icons with images
-trademark mooUFO ( ask amber to fix logo) do i like the brand enough to trademark
+ sidenav when im on an individual blog post
- problem: the sidenav sorts post on the index page. when reader is on a page of in individual blog post, they will expect posts on that topic when they click the sidebar (even though its a sort button)
- solution: I could make a page for each topic and redirect there
- solution: i could load the blog post on the bottom of the individual entry
- solution: get rid of sidebar?
- solution: I could display: none the blog post and make it visible in the index since some of my posts won't be long
- calendar of when my next post with be

-removed ability to sort posts via tag (the tags on individual blog post pictures)
- removed collapsible menu sidenav (the whole thing would collapse b/c it lagged)
-maybe don't cross post to sections (so each post should not be under two topics)
-if its posted on instagram also link it in the blog post
